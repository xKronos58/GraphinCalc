    ### Linear Equations:
    Equations of the form: `ax + b = 0`
    Example: `2x + 3 = 0`
    ### Quadratic Equations:
    Equations of the form: `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`
    Example: `x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0`
    ### Polynomial Equations:
    Equations involving higher-order polynomials.
    Example: `3x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x - 5 = 0`
    ### Exponential Equations:
    Equations with exponential terms, like `a * e^x = b`.
    Example: `2 * e^x = 8`
    ### Logarithmic Equations:
    Equations with logarithmic terms, like `log_a(x) = b`.
    Example: `log_2(x) = 3`
    ### Trigonometric Equations:
    Equations involving trigonometric functions, such as `sin(x) = 0` or `cos(x) = 1`.
    Example: `sin(x) = 0`
    ### Simultaneous Equations:
    Sets of equations with multiple variables.
    Example:
    ```
    2x + 3y = 8
    4x - 2y = 6
    ```
    #### Note :
    When writing simultaneous equations rather that writing just `x` or `y` write `1x` or `1y`
    ### Other Special Functions:
    Equations involving special functions like square roots, absolute values, etc.
    Example: `sqrt(x) - 3 = 0`
    ### Inequalities:
    Equations that represent inequalities rather than exact solutions.
    Example: `3x - 5 < 7`
    ### Parametric Equations:
    Equations that have parameters as input, making it necessary to handle these parameters appropriately.
    Example: `x = t^2, y = 2t`

# CHANGE LOG 
### How to use 
See B-0.01.A, B = beta (version), 0 = major iteration, 01 = minor iteration, A = First in patch order
## B-1.07.A
- Added `Domain.java`
- Added beginning support for `MathMl` for correct equation rendering withn the application
- Fixed bugs within `GCController.java` & `GCMain.java`
- Started `Key To Math` which converts keystrokes into MathML code 
- Added preferences
- Added more methods to `Util.java`
- ### NOTE THIS CHANGELOG IS LIMITED AS IT IS A HASTY COMMIT WILL BE UPDATED IN NEXT PATCH 
## B-1.06.A
- Added graph menu, accesed by left clicking on the equation related to the graph. The menu has two options `Find intersepts` and `Remove Graph`.
- Found a bug when an equation such as `-2-2` an error will occur, The cause is unknown but it is being worked on, for now use `(-2)-2` or `-2+(-2)` as a workaround.
- Added support for customizable key bindings with the keybindings.txt file, not yet implemented into the application but will be in the future.
- Added Find intersects to the graphing plane via the graph menu.
- Added Removal of points that render off the plane so they are not shown.
- Added a error message visible to the user when the equation is invalid leading to a empty stack. 
## B-1.05.A
- Added the ability to remove graphs from the graphing plane, This is done by left clicking on the equation corresponding to the graph you want to remove.
- Refactored the settings menus for better resource file structure.
- More minor work on `Differentiate.java`
- Increased size of the `EquationList.java` and added `wrk` Work for calculating energy output from a force and an angle. Also added `kne` for calculating kinetic energy.
- Fixed bug where if you input an invalid equation and it output -0.0 the scroll panel would not be extended cause some of the future equations to be rendered off the panel. 
- Added past equation cycling for the graphing menu and calculus menu. 
- Updated `Constants.md` to include the new constants and updated the `Constants.java` to include the new constants.
## B-1.04.A
- Added `ans` handling to other methods, allowing for `ans` to be used in places like `solve()` and `expand()` and functions.
- Fixed most* bugs surrounding Functions and how they interact with the other classes.
- Issue with `let[x]=y` If the using `ans` within let if the last answer contained `E` (e.g. `1.2E+3`) it would will throw an error as `E` is not recognised. This will be fixed but as java converts smaller numbers to scientific notation automatically it will come in a later patch.
- Cleaned up `GCController.java` by removing different methods for each button and replacing them with a single method that handles all buttons. This will allow for easier addition of buttons and less clutter.
  - `addText()` takes an `ActionEvent` when used outside of the fxml the even should be parsed as `(new ActionEvent(button, button))`
- Added a visible error message to the user for the `util.untill()` when the car is not found inside the string.

## B-1.03.A-1
Preview of previous changes
![Test.gif](src/images/Test.gif)

## B-1.03.A
- Added Saved equations, allowing you to use the `Up-Arrow` or `Down-Arrow` keys to scroll through previous equations, saving equations from previous sessions.
  - Note it will constantly save equations unless changed in settings (Under general), A new button has been added in the grneral settings to clear the history.
- New File handling methods have been added to `Utils.java` to allow for easier file handling.
  - Including `WriteFile()` & `ReadFile()` & `ClearFile()`

## B-1.02.A
- Added `let[x]=y` function for variable definition. 
  - Usages: `let[a]=12`, `let[b]=a^2`, `b=144`, `9/(pi*b)` will return `0.00198...`
  - Note: `let[x]=y` is not a function, it is a variable definition.

## B-1.01.A
- Fixed Complex numbers so `sqrt(-1)` now renders on the graphing plane. `Complex.java` is still to be implemented inside the calculators to allow for `i` to be used inside calculations. 

## B-1.00.A
- Added `ABSOLUTE_INEQUALLITY()` To the solve function within the `Equation` Enum
- Re-Wrote the `Convert()` Function to start the migration from console based conversion to GUI based conversion.
- Re-Did the `ScientificCalc.fxml` File so that it has the base (To be implemented later)
- Changed the `BasicCalc.fxml` to `CalculusCalc.fxml` and added the base for the calculus calculator
- Added "clear" & "clear type" buttons to the default set of buttons
- Added start of `Let[x]=y` function for variable definition within the calculator. Note currently defining the variable works but using it does not.
- More minor bug fixes inside `HandleStack.java`.
- Cleaned up `GCMain.java` and added more comments
- Added `f(y)` support for graphing to allow for y based graphs to be used like `f(y)=y^2` which creates a parabola along the x instead of the y.
- With the addition of `f(y)` added a method to check if the dots were being rendered on the equation field as previously this was not an issue.
- Added Menus for Constants, Functions & Inequalities using the `remapKeys()` method. 
- Started making the use of different action evens per button obsolete as the `GCController.java` is getting quite large. This will be done through the use of the `Actionevent` being parsed into the method, allowing for the button press to be handled inside a single method. This will also improve clutter and allow for deletion of obsolete methods.
- Started making a `Differentiate()` class to allow for the differentiation of equations. This will be used in the future for the calculus calculator.
- Added support for Scaling the graphs (WIP)
- Fixed the `Constatns.md` to be more up to date as it has not been changed since it was made. 
- Added beginning for Complex Numbers so that negative `sqrt()` graphs and calculations can be done. 
## B-0.07.B 
- Cleaned up and updated `READNE.md`
- Provided new screenshots for application after reworks 
- Fixed minor bug that was not caught with last commit inside the `cqrt[]{}` method as the `()` were changed to `{}` and the application was still searching for `()` to finish the equation.
## B-0.07.A
-  Reworked graph plotting, graphs are now added accurately.
  - NOTE: Graphs that have r() or ^2 are not evaluated correctly in the negatives. Due to an unknown cause 
-  Added detailed comments to the `GCMain.java` class
-  Did some general code cleanup
-  Reworked the `EvaluateGraph()` function now efficiently replaces x and runs the function with updated x value
-  Added accuracy implementations, so izt can now be modified for performance or accuracy. Will be added to settings menu in future, for now is defaulted to `0.01d`
-  Made progress on `Simplify.java` class
## B-0.06.A
-  Added `HCF()` & `LCM()` & `SimplifyQuadratic()`
-  Re-did physics calc button layout. 
- - NOTE functions and constants menus have not been worked on 
-  Added alerts for invalid equations and `errorMessage()` for a predefined error 

## B-0.05.A
-  Added type definition for solve function
-  Added functioning quadratic solving when `solve(t=quadratic(equation=0))`
-  Did work on `Expand.java`
-  Added application icon

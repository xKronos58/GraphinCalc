# CHANGE LOG 
### How to use 
See B-0.01.A, B = beta (version), 0 = major iteration, 01 = minor iteration, A = First in patch order

## B-0.07.B 
- Cleaned up and updated `READNE.md`
- Provided new screenshots for application after reworks 
- Fixed minor bug that was not caught with last commit inside the `cqrt[]{}` method as the `()` were changed to `{}` and the application was still searching for `()` to finish the equation.
## B-0.07.A
-  Reworked graph plotting, graphs are now added accurately.
  - NOTE: Graphs that have r() or ^2 are not evaluated correctly in the negatives. Due to an unknown cause 
-  Added detailed comments to the `GCMain.java` class
-  Did some general code cleanup
-  Reworked the `EvaluateGraph()` function now efficiently replaces x and runs the function with updated x value
-  Added accuracy implementations, so izt can now be modified for performance or accuracy. Will be added to settings menu in future, for now is defaulted to `0.01d`
-  Made progress on `Simplify.java` class
## B-0.06.A
-  Added `HCF()` & `LCM()` & `SimplifyQuadratic()`
-  Re-did physics calc button layout. 
- - NOTE functions and constants menus have not been worked on 
-  Added alerts for invalid equations and `errorMessage()` for a predefined error 

## B-0.05.A
-  Added type definition for solve function
-  Added functioning quadratic solving when `solve(t=quadratic(equation=0))`
-  Did work on `Expand.java`
-  Added application icon
